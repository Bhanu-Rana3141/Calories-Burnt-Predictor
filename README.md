This project is a Calories Burnt Predictor model built using AI/ML techniques to predict the number of calories burned during exercise based on various factors such as gender, age, height, weight, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature.

The model utilizes the following libraries and tools:

NumPy: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
Pandas: For data processing and handling datasets.
Matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting graphs.
Scikit-learn: For building and training machine learning models.
XGBoost: A high-performance regressor used to predict the target variable (calories burnt).

Input Features:
Gender (Male/Female)
Age (Age of the individual)
Height (Height in cm)
Weight (Weight in kg)
Exercise Duration (Time spent exercising in minutes)
Heart Rate (Heart rate during exercise in beats per minute)
Body Temperature (Body temperature during exercise in Â°C)

Output:
The model predicts the calories burnt during the exercise based on the input features.
